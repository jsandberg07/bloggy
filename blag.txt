so we making a blog aggregator
-add rss feeds from the internet
-store posts in postgreSQL db
-follow and unfollow RSS feeds- view summaries in the terminal, with full links to posts 

goals
-go app with postgreSQL (i am pretty ok at go)
-SQL to query and migrate database (sqlc and goose)
-long running service that works in the background or something

the main is all fucked up.
What's the QRD on how it actually works.
1. create a config. The config reads from a file in the root. 
Config us just dbURL and current username.

2. config is stored in the state. 
State is currently just the config BUT it's a public thing that you pass.

3. Create a map of commands.
Map is stores in the commands struct.

4. register the command. It's a name and a function. Probably a better way to do this.

5. check the arguments. if too short, it's abort. 
6. split arugments into command name and params.
7. create a COMMAND which then runs, returning an error.

Gotta rename things.
I guess we using run . additional args more than like building and whatever.
